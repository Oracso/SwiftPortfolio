## [SwiftUI CV](https://github.com/Oracso/SwiftUI-CV)

### Overview:

My **SwiftUI** CV that has been designed and built dynamically within **Xcode** using **SwiftUI**.

### Use Case:

Having a CV template that dynamically adapts to updates while maintaining its theme and structure enables CVs to be seamlessly tailored to specific job roles. 

This separation of a CV's content from its design allows users to select themes contextually, keeping their CVs professional and appropriate for each application. 

Further, this approach also facilitates content version control, allowing users to easily manage multiple versions attuned to particular roles or as they are updated throughout a career.

## [CoreData State Management](https://github.com/Oracso/CoreData-State-Management)

### Overview:

An example **SwiftUI** project using **CoreData** to manage dynamic object data over time.

### Use Case:

This project serves as an exemplary demonstration of the extensive versatility and wide-ranging applicability of my CoreData infrastructure framework.

Consisting of mainly generic code, designed to be reusable across numerous contexts, it requires minimal modification or changes before being a fully operational and adaptable solution for managing object data over time.

Its robust architecture and modular design ensure scalability and seamless integration, keeping it suitable for a myriad of applications across various domains and making it an invaluable asset for any development team.

My optimized code streamlines and refines **CoreData** implementation, reducing the need for extensive customisation and thus allowing developers to concentrate on the core functionality on their projects.

## [Custom Xcode Project Template](https://github.com/Oracso/Custom-Xcode-Project-Template)

### Overview:

A custom Xcode project template used to dynamically generate a simple hierarchical **SwiftUI** project.

### Use Case:

*Custom Xcode project templates* leverage the power of dynamic file creation across an entire project. Where code snippets can be used to insert generic code, *custom Xcode file templates* allow the dynamic injection of boilerplate code within known bounds, with *custom project templates* doing the same over larger projects. 

By typing a *struct*'s name once at the start of a project, files can be dynamically populated with the project ready to run using relevant nomenclature.  

Further, *custom project templates* facilitate the creation of document directory hierarchies, reducing the time needed to structure files into pre-planned layouts.

## [Watch Haptics](https://github.com/Oracso/WatchHaptics)

### Overview:

An independent **WatchOS** app that schedules customisable repeating haptic notifications.

### Use Case:

Regular and repeating haptic notifications are a useful and versatile tool with a range of applications. Distinct from typical **NotificationCenter** notifications, this **WatchOS** haptic app provides users with the ability to adapt notification frequency and intensity tailored to unique situations and individual needs. 

A simple and intuitive interface allows for the swift deployment of either pre-configured interval-based notifications or continuous, uninterrupted notifications, ensuring flexibility in haptic delivery suitable for any situation. 

Utilising this application empowers users to remain informed and connected throughout their day, enriching their overall experience with Apple's wearable technology.

## [Quick Maths App](https://github.com/Oracso/QuickMaths)

### Overview:

A timed and adjustable arithmetic app that enhances numerical/mathematical proficiency and provides detailed post-game analysis.

### Use Case:

Designed to enhance mathematical dexterity, users can choose from a variety of game types, each allowing for customisation of variables such as number range and frequency.

This capability allows users to hone their skills in unique and interesting ways while receiving comprehensive post-game analysis to track progress and identify areas for improvement.

A thorough statistics page offers users complete control over filtering variables, allowing them to tailor their analysis within specific parameters and display their results with intuitive graphical representations.

Whether simply for enjoyment, for tracking and evaluating performance over time or for strengthening numerical proficiency, this app is a personalised and indispensable tool for individuals looking to promote mathematical fluency and independent learning.

## [Blood Pressure Tracker](https://github.com/Oracso/BloodPressureTracker)

### Overview:

A customisable blood pressure app that tracks changes in readings over time.

### Use Case:

Customising the presentation of data in a way that is relevant and engaging is key to the creation of usable insights.

This can be achieved by granting users control of filtering variables as well as providng flexibility in design and appearance.

Empowering users with this flexibility allows them to tailor their interface to align with their unique requirements, facilitating a more personalised analysis.

Further, being able to tag readings with custom confounders incorporates additional contextual information that enhances the depth of understanding derived from the data.

### Overview:

A catalogue of common Swift bugs and a record of my fixes for them.

### Use Case:

I found it hard keeping track of all the bugs I found and my different fixes for them so I decided collate them into a *GitHub* repository. Feel free to browse and let me know if you find any bugs inside my bug fixes or have any suggestions to add. 

### Highlights:
